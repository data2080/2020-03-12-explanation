# Welcome to online class

--
1. Our goal is to support you
--
1. Breath in, breathe out
> class today will be a chance to get through
--
1. We want remote learning to be as high quality as in person
--
1. Some aspects will be different, we're all learning together
> let us know what works and what does not, so that we van learn together
--
1. At the end of class, I'll ask for feedback
> this exit ticket will be used to summarize feedback and shared with other DSI instructors so that we can all work together to make it work as well as possible.

# Themes in your Questions from last week

_you all asked really great questions_

--
- Interpretability, Accuracy, and Complexity
--
- Model Reconstruction
--
- Interpretability as a means to other goals?
--
- Interpretability for who? and governance
--
- Consensus building
--
- Do we really need this?

# Dimensions of the Explanation

- problem or goal (model explanation, outcome explanation, model inspection, transparent design)
- explanator type
- black box type
- data type
--
- specific or general
--
- global vs local
- actions of the model vs inputs of the model

# Model Explanation

## Strategies
- global solution
- typically approximation via interpretable by fiat model
  - decision trees
  - rule extraction
  - feature importance ranking measure
- in terms of actions or inputs

## When do we want this?

# Outcome Explanation

- Saliency Maps
- ExpainD graphical explanation
- LIME

## When do we want this?

----
name: inspection
